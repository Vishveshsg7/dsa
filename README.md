# SPPU_DSAL
hello guys !
I have uploaded simpliest and shortest codes of data structure and algorithm Lab codes collected from Github ^^^^
this codes are from syllabus of SE ( Semester 4 ) artificial intelligence and Data Science / Computer engineering 
which comes under SPPU
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

GROUP A:

assignment 1 :) Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation
                 to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling
                 techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of
                 telephone numbers

assignment 2 :) Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using hashing and handle collisions
                 using chaining with / without replacement.
                 Data: Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable,
                 Keys must be unique. Standard Operations: Insert(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key)

GROUP B:

assignment 5 :) A book consists of chapters, chapters consist of sections and sections consist of
                 subsections. Construct a tree and print the nodes. Find the time and space requirements of
                 your method. 

assignment 6 :) Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the
                 values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree -
                 i. Insert new node, ii. Find number of nodes in longest path from root, iii. Minimum data
                 value found in the tree, iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are
                 swapped at every node, v. Search a value 
                 
assignment 7 :) Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg. +--a*bc/def and
                 traverse it using post order traversal (non recursive) and then delete the entire tree.

GROUP C :

assignment 13 :) Represent a given graph using adjacency matrix/list to perform DFS and using adjacency
                  list to perform BFS. Use the map of the area around the college as the graph. Identify the
                  prominent land marks as nodes and perform DFS and BFS on that.
                  
assignment 14 :) There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then
                  there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take to
                  reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph.
                  The node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list
                  representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Check
                  whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used.

GROUP D :   

assignment 18 :) Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < … <kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi for
                  each key ki . Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access
                  probability for each key?
                  
assignment 19 :) A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new
                  keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display
                  whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum
                  comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Height balance tree and find the
                  complexity for finding a keyword

GROUP E :

assignment 22 :) Read the marks obtained by students of second year in an online examination of
                  particular subject. Find out maximum and minimum marks obtained in that subject. Use
                  heap data structure. Analyze the algorithm.

GROUP F :

assignment 23 :) Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name,
                 division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display
                 information of particular employee. If record of student does not exist an appropriate
                 message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details. Use sequential
                 file to main the data. 
                 
assignment 24 :) Company maintains employee information as employee ID, name, designation and salary.
                 Allow user to add, delete information of employee. Display information of particular
                 employee. If employee does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then
                 the system displays the employee details. Use index sequential file to maintain the data.
